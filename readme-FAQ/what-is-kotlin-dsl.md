  What is Kotlin DSL?
</h2>
<blockquote>
<span><!-- leave the next line blank -->

Domain-specific languages, or DSLs, are languages specialized for a specific part of an app.  
It is used to extract a part of the code to make it reusable and more understandable.  
<br/>
As opposed to a function or a method, DSLs also change the way you use and write code.  
Usually, DSLs make the code more readable, almost like a spoken language.  
<br/>
This means that even people  
who don’t understand the architecture behind the code  
will be able to grasp the meaning of it.  
<br/>
***Kotlin DSL*** is used in [***Gradle***](what-is-gradle.md), alternatively to *Groovy*.  
Just like the *Groovy*-based equivalent,  ***Kotlin DSL*** is implemented on top of Gradle’s Java API.  
Everything you can read in a Kotlin DSL script is Kotlin code compiled and executed by Gradle.  
<br/>
Many of the objects, functions and properties you use in your build scripts  
come from the Gradle API and the APIs of the applied plugins.  
<br/>
To make a DSL means to change the syntax of that specific part of the code.  
In ***Kotlin***, this is achieved by using lambda, extension functions and expressions  
to remove a lot of boilerplate code and hide the internal implementation from the user.

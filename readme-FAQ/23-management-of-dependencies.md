Gradle build script defines a process to build projects.  
Each project contains some dependencies.  
Dependencies refer to the things that supports in building your project,  
such as required JAR file from other projects and external JARs.  
<br/>
All the projects are not self-contained.  
They need files which are built by the other projects  
to compile and test the source files.  
<br/>
Gradle uses build scripts to define the dependencies, which needs to be downloaded.  
<br/>
Gradle also can handle building and publishing the outcomes.  
Publishing is based on the task that you define.  
<br/>  
It might want to copy the files to local directory,  
or upload them to a remote repository  
or you might use the files from another project  
in the same multi-project build.  
<br/>
We can call the process of publishing a task as *publication*.  
Dependency configuration defines a set of dependencies.  
You can use this feature to declare external dependencies,  
which you want to download from the web.

  What is an Artifact Repository?
</h2>
<blockquote>
<span><!-- leave the next line blank -->

An artifact repository stores build artifacts  
produced by continuous integration and makes them available  
for automated deployment to testing, staging, and production environments.  
<br/>
Build artifacts are the files created by the build process, such as distribution packages.
